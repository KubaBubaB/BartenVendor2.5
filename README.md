# BartenVendor2.5
 
Another take on this project. It is small desktop Java app. You type in ingredients you have in your home-bar, it tells you back cocktails you can make out of your ingredients. You can add your own recipes, categories of ingredients etc. In late development I've planned some other additional functions like small descriptions and guides on how to make better cocktails :)

Current status: WIP
TBA:
-Everything ;)
